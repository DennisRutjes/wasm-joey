Wasm-joey is written in Node.js. It is easy to set up and deploy. All configuration is stored in the application's base directory. It can be deployed on any machine that can run Node. It's continual operation is performed via HTTP requests and responses. This means that developers, end users and even computer-code itself can easily manage and execute WebAssembly code in a number of ways (including but not limited to) [Javascript (XMLHttpRequest)](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_http.asp), [jQuery(ajax)](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/), [Curl (command line/shell)](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html#POST) or any HTTP REST client such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
